<h1 align="center">ðŸ™¦ Bunco ðŸ™¤</h1>

<p align="center">By Firch & RENREN<p />

Ever wanted to use REAL NUKE on your cards? Or maybe you wanted to see cards from other popular videogames? Or you want some mod that doesn't look too out of place?

### Bunco is a **Balatro** expansion mod that currently adds:
**20 new**, carefully crafted discoverable **Jokers**;\
**2 new** hidden **Tarots**;\
**4 New**... **Poker hands** and... **Planets?**\
**2 completely new**... This can't be true, I'm not reading this list anymore.

## FAQ:
**Q:** How to install?\
**A:** You need Steamodded to play with this mod. [Download here](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/releases).\
Then you simply drop the Bunco folder into your mods folder.

**Q:** I got crash/something is weird! What do I do?\
**A:** Write details about your issue in Balatro's Discord: [link to the thread](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1220084296346501201/1220084296346501201).

**Q:** I can't see any cards in my collection!\
**A:** That's not a question. But I'll answer anyways, the Jokers are needed to be discovered first, just like in the base game.

## Known bugs/weird things:
- The preview for new Poker Hands is a bit broken visually in the handlist
- Probably doesn't work as intended with other suit mods
